# Machine-Learning-for-Phishing-Detection
This project applies machine learning to detect phishing websites by analyzing structural and behavioral signals that indicate deception. It aims to provide an automated, real-time solution to protect users from phishing attacks, which continue to evolve and bypass traditional detection methods.

The dataset contains 46 features for each of the 10,000 websites, split between phishing and legitimate sites. These features are used for model training and evaluation. The dataset can be found in the data/ directory.
